    "- Stateless serving\n",
    "    - This patter allows to scale and handle thousands or even millions of predictions requests per second\n",
    "- Batch Serving\n",
    "    - Asynchronously handle occasional or periodic requests for millions to billions of predictions\n",

    "- Continued model evaluation\n",
    "    - Patterns that handle common problem of detecting when a deployed model is no longer fit-for-purpose"

    "## Design Pattern 16: Stateless Serving Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statless function is a function whose outputs are determined purely by its inputs\n",
    "- A function that maintains a counter of the number of times it's been called is stateful\n",
    "    - Can be done via class variables\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Because stateless components don't have any state, they can be shared by multiple clients\n",
    "- Servers typically create a pool of statelss components and use them to service client requests as they come in\n",
    "- On the other hand, stateful components will need to represent each clients conversational state\n",
    "- Lifecycle of stateless components needs to be mandages by the serve\n",
    "    - e.g. initialised on clients first request and then destroyed when the client terminates or times out\n",
    "    - Becuase of these factors stateless components are highly scalable\n",
    "    - Where as stateful components are expensive and difficult to manage\n",
    "- Web applications transfer state from the clients to the server with each call\n",
    "\n",
    "- In ML a lot of state is captured during training\n",
    "- When the model is exported / saved we reqiuire the model framework to keep track of these stateful variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- When stateless functions are used, it simplifies the server code and makes it more scalable but can make client code more complicated\n",
    "    - e.g. A spelling correction model has to know the previous few words in order to correct words"

    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Image we have a deep learning model trained (kera flavour)\n",
    "- Model makes predictions on how positive the reviews are for a film, therefore has a embedding layer\n",
    "- We use this model to make predictions via the `predict` call\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several problems carrying out inference by calling `model.predict()` on an in memory object \n",
    "    - Loaded enitre keras model into memory, with all embeddings and layers this can be very large for deep learning models\n",
    "    - The preceding architechture imposes limits on the latency that can be achieved because calls to the `predict()` method have to be sent one by one\n",
    "    - Model input and output is most effective for training and may not be user friendly. The model may output [logits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) but clients may want the sigmoid of that so that the output range is between 0 and 1. This can then me interpreted more as a probability. Model may have also been trained on compressed binary records where as the input format from the client may be a JSON."
